# ActiveSessionRecorder
Recording active sessions within the server


It is a temporary solution produced to record the people who access the files on the servers sharing in the common area. It was developed to detect the existing folders accessed by people accessing the area before moving them to the new server and to move them without interruption.


Install the ps code in #RecordActiveSharedFileSession and SaveActiveUsersIpAdress files to run once a minute via taskschedule.

Wait 1-2 weeks for the data to be collected, then you can run the #Report file and make your analysis.
